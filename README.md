# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to summarize ride-sharing data by city type to better examine trends at the city level. By creating a city type summary DataFrame and graphing total fares by city, we can provide PyBer with knowledge that they can utilize when making business decisions in varying locations.

## Results
By looking at both the city type summary DataFrame and the "Total Fare By City Type" graph below, one can see that from the data given:
- Urban cities have the most rides, drivers, and total fares
- Suburban cities have the 2nd most rides, drivers, and total fares
- Rural cities have the least rides, drivers, and total fares
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver
- Suburban cities have the 2nd lowest average fare per ride and per driver
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per driver
